# AgriData_Explorer
**AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA:**
* This project analyzes India’s agriculture production data using SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover trends, top performers, and growth patterns across states and districts.

**Tools used:**

**Database:** MySQL (queries + dump included)
**Analysis:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
**Visualization:** Power BI (3 report pages)

**MySQL** – Wrote 10+ optimized SQL queries to answer business-style questions (e.g., top rice-producing states, wheat yield trends, oilseed growth).
**Python** – Cleaned & explored the dataset with Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for validation and EDA.
**Power BI** – Built 3 interactive dashboards to visualize crop yield, production growth, and state/district comparisons.

**Key_Insights:**

* Identified top 3 rice-producing states and their yearly performance trends.
* Found districts with the highest wheat yield increase in the last 5 years.
* Ranked states by oilseed production growth to highlight emerging leaders.
* Compared rice vs wheat production across top 5 states over a decade.
* Created state & district-level dashboards for groundnut, maize, cotton, and oilseeds.

**Outcome:**
* Clear insights into India’s crop production patterns → useful for policy planning, supply chain monitoring, and agri-business strategy
